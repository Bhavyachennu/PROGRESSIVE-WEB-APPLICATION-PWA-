The **PWA E-Commerce** website is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to offer a modern and interactive shopping experience with vibrant and dynamic visuals. The website includes a clear, easy-to-navigate layout with the following features:
Header Section:
- **Text ("MY PWA E-COMMERCE")**:
  - The header now has a **solid blue background** (`#007bff`) with **white text**. This design choice makes the website's title stand out with a professional, clean look while ensuring readability.
  - The text is styled in **uppercase**, **bold**, and **spaced out** to give it a modern, bold appearance.
  - The header’s size and padding are adjusted to make the title prominent and give a large visual emphasis.
Background Effect:
  - The background of the website is a **moving gradient** (rainbow colors), giving it a dynamic and colorful feel. The gradient smoothly transitions between six colors: red, orange, green, blue, purple, and pink.
  - The animation effect (`@keyframes rainbowBackground`) ensures that the background moves smoothly over time, creating an eye-catching effect.
Product Section:
- **Products Display**:
  - The product section is laid out using a **flexbox layout** to center the products and allow for responsive design. The products automatically adjust their position and size depending on the screen size.
  - The section features three product cards, each representing an item with an image, a title, a price in Indian Rupees (₹), and a button to add the product to the cart.
Product Card Styling:
  - Each product card has a **light background** with a **rounded corner** and a subtle **shadow effect**, making the cards stand out while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic.
  - The **hover effect** scales the product card slightly, drawing the user's attention and creating an interactive feel.
  - **Rainbow gradient backgrounds** are applied to the product cards, making them colorful and adding a dynamic feel to the page.
Buttons:
- The **"Add to Cart"** button is styled with a **bright pink color** (`#FF0066`) to make it stand out and be easily noticeable. When hovered over, it changes to **yellow** (`#ff9900`), providing a subtle feedback effect that engages the user.
Text Styling:
- **Product Title**: The product names are displayed in a vibrant **yellow color** (`#ffcc00`), making them pop and ensuring that users can easily distinguish between products.
- **Product Price**: The prices are styled in **light blue** (`#00ccff`), giving them a cool, modern tone that contrasts well with the product titles.
Responsive Design:
- The layout is designed to be **fully responsive**. When the screen size is smaller (such as on mobile devices), the product cards stack vertically, ensuring the website remains user-friendly on all devices.
- The product cards take up the full width of the screen on smaller devices, offering an optimal viewing experience.
Animations:
- The **header** and **product card backgrounds** feature **animations** that cycle through the rainbow colors, creating a lively, engaging experience for users.
- The **background animation** ensures a smooth transition of colors over time, while the **product card animation** keeps the page feeling fresh and dynamic.
Overall Experience:
This e-commerce website is designed to be engaging, modern, and mobile-friendly, providing a **fun yet professional shopping experience**. The vibrant rainbow theme creates a unique and colorful aesthetic, while the clean layout ensures easy navigation. The use of PWA technologies ensures that the website is **fast, reliable**, and works well across different platforms.
